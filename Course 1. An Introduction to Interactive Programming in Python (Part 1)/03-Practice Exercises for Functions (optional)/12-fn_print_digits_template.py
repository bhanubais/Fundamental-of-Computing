'''Challenge: Write a Python function `print_digits` that takes an integer `number` in the range [0,100), i.e., at least 0, but less than 100. It prints the message "The tens digit is %, and the ones digit is %.", where the percent signs should be replaced with the appropriate values. (Hint: Use the arithmetic operators for integer division // and remainder % to find the two digits. Note that this function should print the desired message, rather than returning it as a string.)
'''
# Compute and print tens and ones digit of an integer in [0,100).

# Digits function
# Student should enter function on the next lines.

def print_digits(num):
    tens = num // 10
    ones = num % 10
    print(f"The tens digit is {tens}, and the ones digit is {ones}.")

print_digits(42)
print_digits(99)
print_digits(5)

# Expected output
# Student should look at the following comments and compare to printed output.

#The tens digit is 4, and the ones digit is 2.
#The tens digit is 9, and the ones digit is 9.
#The tens digit is 0, and the ones digit is 5.
